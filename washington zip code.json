The greatest chance for code orange air quality is in the Hampton Roads/Norfolk/Tidewater/Chesapeake/Virginia Beach areas where the front will not pass until evening. Code orange conditions are also possible but less likely for the 24-hour period in the Richmond area before the front passes in the early afternoon. Prior to the cold front in both areas, southwesterly winds may bring wildfire smoke into the region. If you can smell or see smoke, code orange conditions are likely occurring. Sensitive individuals (children, the elderly, and those with heart conditions) should limit strenuous outdoor activities. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether this will occur.

These conditions will continue through tonight and the first half of the day Saturday.  We are doing something different to better protect and inform the public about this bad air quality event.  The first half of the day will continue to be in the ORANGE range.  Smoke will continue to cover the region until a cold front sweeps through the Triad tomorrow around noon.  At this point, we expect the AQI readings to decrease back into the GREEN range as clean air pushes in behind the front.  The difference will be quite noticeable as the smoke clears and a cooler northwest wind brings much needed relief to those who are suffering through this smoke event.  We should see a couple days of good air quality as the northwest winds remain in place through Monday.   (Bodenhamer)"}]

There is some potential for code orange/unhealthy for sensitive groups air quality in eastern Virginia on Saturday, prior to a strong cold front crossing the state. The greatest chance for code orange air quality is in the Hampton Roads/Norfolk/Tidewater/Chesapeake/Virginia Beach areas where the front will not pass until evening. Code orange conditions are also possible but less likely for the 24-hour period in the Richmond area before the front passes in the early afternoon. Prior to the cold front in both areas, southwesterly winds may bring wildfire smoke into the region. If you can smell or see smoke, code orange conditions are likely occurring. Sensitive individuals (children, the elderly, and those with heart conditions) should limit strenuous outdoor activities. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether this will occur. For now, although there could be a period with poor air quality prior to the cold front passage, we are forecasting moderate air quality for particle pollution for the 24-hour period on Saturday for the Hampton Roads/Norfolk/Tidewater/Chesapeake/Virginia Beach areas considering that the strong winds with and behind the cold front will rapidly clean out the region.***"},{"DateIssue":"2016-11-18 ","DateForecast":"2016-11-21 ","ReportingArea":"Richmond","StateCode":"VA","Latitude":37.531,"Longitude":-77.475,"ParameterName":"PM2.5","AQI":21,"Category":{"Number":1,"Name":"Good"},"ActionDay":false,"Discussion":"***SPECIAL DISCUSSION as of 1:30 pm Friday: We continue to monitor wildfire smoke from large fires in western North Carolina and northern Georgia.
